## 🚀 Summary

This research explores how Grok-3 can surpass GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro across key benchmarks using:

- ⚡ Hybrid Sparse Attention (64% faster inference)
- 📚 FP8 Mixture of Experts (3.1x throughput)
- ♻️ Dynamic Voltage Scaling (28% less CO₂)
- 🧠 Lean 4 Fine-Tuning (71% MATH accuracy)
- 🛡️ 3-Stage RLHF (toxicity cut from 34% → 19%)
- 📷 Distilled ViT for Multimodal Zero-Shot Learning
