# Experiments

This file outlines potential fine-tuning experiments and ablation studies for Grok-3.1.

## Planned Experiments

- Compare Grok-3.1 vs. LLaMA-2 on reasoning benchmarks.
- Measure context-length generalization using synthetic datasets.
- Evaluate training speed and convergence under different optimizer schedules.
- Add PEFT-based LoRA fine-tuning for domain adaptation.

## Notes

Currently, no experiments have been run. This file will be updated once experimental results are available.
